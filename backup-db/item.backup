Their findings are published today in Nature Medicine.</p>
<p>The AI model uses data from the COVID Symptom Study app to predict COVID-19 infection, by comparing people''s symptoms and the results of traditional COVID tests. Researchers say this may provide help for populations where access to testing is limited. Two clinical trials in the UK and the US are due to start shortly.</p>
<p>More than 3.3 million people globally have downloaded the app and are using it to report daily on their health status, whether they feel well or have any new symptoms such as persistent cough, fever, fatigue and loss of taste or smell (anosmia).</p>
<p>In this study, the researchers analysed data gathered from just under 2.5 million people in the UK and US who had been regularly logging their health status in the app, around a third of whom had logged symptoms associated with COVID-19. Of these, 18,374 reported having had a test for coronavirus, with 7,178 people testing positive.</p>
<p>The research team investigated which symptoms known to be associated with COVID-19 were most likely to be associated with a positive test. They found a wide range of symptoms compared to cold and flu, and warn against focusing only on fever and cough. Indeed, they found loss of taste and smell (anosmia) was particularly striking, with two thirds of users testing positive for coronavirus infection reporting this symptom compared with just over a fifth of the participants who tested negative. The findings suggest that anosmia is a stronger predictor of COVID-19 than fever, supporting anecdotal reports of loss of smell and taste as a common symptom of the disease.</p>
<p>The researchers then created a mathematical model that predicted with nearly 80% accuracy whether an individual is likely to have COVID-19 based on their age, sex and a combination of four key symptoms: loss of smell or taste, severe or persistent cough, fatigue and skipping meals. Applying this model to the entire group of over 800,000 app users experiencing symptoms predicted that just under a fifth of those who were unwell (17.42%) were likely to have COVID-19 at that time.</p>
<p>Researchers suggest that combining this AI prediction with widespread adoption of the app could help to identify those who are likely to be infectious as soon as the earliest symptoms start to appear, focusing tracking and testing efforts where they are most needed.</p>
<p>Professor Tim Spector from King''s College London said: "Our results suggest that loss of taste or smell is a key early warning sign of COVID-19 infection and should be included in routine screening for the disease. We strongly urge governments and health authorities everywhere to make this information more widely known, and advise anyone experiencing sudden loss of smell or taste to assume that they are infected and follow local self-isolation guidelines."</p>', 'https://www.ehealthnews.eu/research/6146-new-ai-diagnostic-can-predict-covid-19-without-testing, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0916-2', 0, 0, 0);

<p id="P3" class="p p-first-last">Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated remarkable progress in image-recognition tasks. Methods ranging from convolutional neural networks to variational autoencoders have found myriad applications in the medical image analysis field, propelling it forward at a rapid pace. Historically, in radiology practice, trained physicians visually assessed medical images for the detection, characterization and monitoring of diseases. AI methods excel at automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative, rather than qualitative, assessments of radiographic characteristics. In this O pinion article, we establish a general understanding of AI methods, particularly those pertaining to image-based tasks. We explore how these methods could impact multiple facets of radiology, with a general focus on applications in oncology, and demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing clinical implementation and provide our perspective on how the domain could be advanced.</p>

While various deep learning architectures have been explored to address different tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most prevalent deep learning architecture typologies in medical imaging today<sup><a id="__tag_738802645" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6268174/#R14" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">14</a></sup>.

<p>The electronic <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/cross_border_care/overview_en">cross-border health</a> service is an infrastructure ensuring the continuity of care for European citizens while they are travelling abroad in the EU. This gives EU countries the possibility to exchange health data in a secure, efficient and interoperable way.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The following two electronic cross-border health services are currently progressively introduced in all EU countries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ePrescription (and eDispensation)</strong> allows EU citizens to obtain their medication in a pharmacy located in another EU country, thanks to the online transfer of their electronic prescription from their country of residence where they are affiliated, to their country of travel.</li>
<li><strong>Patient Summary</strong> provides information on important health related aspects such as allergies, current medication, previous illness, surgeries, etc. It is part of&nbsp; a larger collection of health data called electronic Health Record. The digital Patient Summary is meant to provide doctors with essential information in their own language concerning the patient, when the patient comes from another EU country and there may be a linguistic barrier. On a longer term, not only the basic medical information of the Patient Summary, but the full Health Record should become available across the EU. The exchange of ePrescriptions and Patient Summaries is open to all the Member States.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both ePrescriptions and Patient Summaries can be exchanged between EU countries thanks to the new eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure (eHDSI).</p>
<p>By 2021, both services will gradually be implemented in 22 EU countries: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.</p>

<p>Estonia, home to one of the world&rsquo;s most e-savvy governments, has become the first country to dabble in <strong>using blockchain for healthcare on a national scale</strong>. In 2016, the <a href="http://www.e-tervis.ee/index.php/en/">Estonian E-Health Foundation</a> launched a development project aimed at safeguarding patient health records using blockchain technology in archiving related activity logs.</p>
<blockquote class="c-blockquote__content">
<div class="c-blockquote__body">Estonia has become the first country to use #blockchain for healthcare on a national scale</div>
<footer class="c-blockquote__footer"></footer></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We are using blockchain as an additional layer of security to help us ensure the integrity of health records. Privacy and integrity of healthcare information are a top priority for the government and <strong>we are happy to work with innovative technologies like the blockchain</strong> to make sure our records are kept safe,&rdquo; said Artur Novek, the foundation&rsquo;s Implementation Manager and Architect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the health records that are secured using blockchain, but the <strong>log files that record all the data processing activities</strong> performed on those records. Securing such highly private health information from prying eyes is only part of the goal. It is just as important to mitigate every risk that life-critical personal data could become compromised by an unwitting or malicious hacker or a fraudulent insider.</p>
<h3>Digital watchdog</h3>
<p>An archive or ledger with a backbone built on blockchain technology can <strong>record and timestamp each instance of access</strong> or each change to a patient&rsquo;s electronic records. Its cryptographic hash functions create an unchangeable audit trail that can be monitored. It also guarantees that the most recent version of the record is always used.</p>
<p>In Estonia&rsquo;s case, a private digital ledger has been integrated into the ledger at the E-Health Foundation to record and track patient medical data. One of the goals was to have real-time awareness of the integrity of the stored data, so that administrators could see any breaches and act immediately to limit damage. Mostly though, it&rsquo;s about barring would-be electronic intruders and keeping alterations from happening in the first place.</p>
<p>The project in Estonia is still a work in progress, but <strong>I believe that other nations that use electronic health records could soon follow suit</strong>.</p>

<p>NIECR will sit on top of the current HSC information systems to give health and social care professionals a single window into the key information that a patient expects the different professionals involved in their care to have about them.</p>
<p>The NIECR will contain information from existing electronic record systems from hospitals and clinics throughout Northern Ireland. This will include: lab tests, x-rays, appointments and discharge letters.</p>

Suboptimal care is reported in each phase of surgical care, from the time of consent to discharge and long-term follow-up. Novel strategies are thus needed to address these challenges to produce effective and sustainable improvements in surgical care across the care pathway. The eHealth programs represent a potential strategy for improving the quality of care delivered across various phases of care, thereby improving patient outcomes. This discussion paper describes (1) the key functions of eHealth programs including information gathering, transfer, and exchange; (2) examples of eHealth programs in overcoming challenges to optimal surgical care across the care pathway; and (3) the potential challenges and future directions for implementing eHealth programs in this setting. The eHealth programs are a promising alternative for collecting patient-reported outcome data, providing access to credible health information and strategies to enable patients to take an active role in their own health care, and promote efficient communication between patients and health care providers. However, additional rigorous intervention studies examining the needs of potential role of eHealth programs in augmenting patients&rsquo; preparation and recovery from surgery, and subsequent impact on patient outcomes and processes of care are needed to advance the field. Furthermore, evidence for the benefits of eHealth programs in supporting carers and strategies to maximize engagement from end users are needed.</p>

<h3 id="__sec5title">Information Gathering</h3>
<p id="__p5" class="p p-first-last">Variation in the type and quality of information obtained by clinicians during clinical interviews occurs as a consequence of time and resource constraints, as well as individual clinicians&rsquo; bias [<a id="__tag_503367860" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4705017/#ref15" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">15</a>]. Utilizing self-report assessments of eHealth programs via tablets can improve data integrity by standardizing information collected by clinicians. To reduce complexity and data-collection time, algorithms can be built-in to the software so that items can be auto-populated or skipped based on responses. Programs can be developed so that patients can access and complete assessments outside the clinic environment before surgical consultations.</p>

<h3 id="__sec6title">Information Transfer</h3>
<p id="__p6" class="p p-first-last">The eHealth programs can connect patients with credible, standard information and support regardless of geographic location, the clinician providing care, or the resources of the institution. A credible single source of information is critical given the quantity and variable quality of information available on the Internet [<a id="__tag_503367904" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4705017/#ref16" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">16</a>]. When evidence-based practice recommendations change, information can be updated easily and quickly. Patients can control the number of times they access eHealth programs and the level of information they search and obtain. Providing information tailored to an individual&rsquo;s knowledge and preferences reduces anxiety, improves information comprehension, and recall [<a id="__tag_503367895" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4705017/#ref17" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">17</a>].</p>

<h3 id="__sec7title">Information Exchange</h3>
<p id="__p7" class="p p-first-last">Health information exchanges (ie, electronic health records) are available as a platform for key information to be made available to authorized health care providers across care settings to promote continuity. This is especially relevant for older patients and those with multiple comorbidities, given the range of health care providers they may encounter. For example, health information exchanges have the potential to support the electronic sharing of clinical data across organizations, offering timely and complete medical records at the point of care. Immediate access to medical records or investigation results can increase satisfaction and treatment compliance [<a id="__tag_503367902" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4705017/#ref18" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">18</a>] and reduce medical errors and complaints against services [<a id="__tag_503367875" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4705017/#ref19" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">19</a>].</p>

Despite the large number of eHealth projects to date, the actual use of eHealth interventions is lower than expected. Many projects in Health fail to survive beyond the pilot phase and studies that investigate the effectiveness of eHealth applications most often do not show long-term effects. The ongoing concern in academic literature about these shortcomings situates eHealth as an immature research domain not capable to follow the golden standards of high quality research in health psychology and behavioral medicine. On the other side, in lifestyle or mental health interventions positive results with internet-based interventions can be observed and patients favor internet interventions. Therefore, we will discuss how to make eHealth interventions more enjoyable, feasible, and cost-effective. Objectives: In this workshop we demonstrate how eHealth interventions can be improved, using technology as a driver for adherence and behavior change. In our workshop we introduce a new approach to guide the development of eHealth interventions. The approach is based on an integration of theories form behavioural sciences and persuasive technology. The purpose of the workshop is first, to provide new opportunities to develop eHealth interventions that are user centred and that are implementable in practice, second to discuss an agenda for future research in eHealth for health psychology and behavioral medicine-interventions. Learning outcomes are insight in how to use technology to develop eHealth interventions that work, help and are cost effective, and knowledge about how to evaluate the effects of eHealth interventions on adherence and outcomes. Workshop activities: The workshop starts with a demonstration of examples of eHealth interventions to support self-care and safe-care. Interventions we focus on are blended therapy for depression, selfmanagement applications to support patients with chronic diseases, and applications to support medical professionals to increase safety at work. The examples will be discussed alongside the new approach for development and implementation to improve eHealth interventions. Persuasive Technology will be highlighted as a strategy to increase the adherence to eHealth interventions. The effects of persuasive technology on adherence and its&rsquo; consequences for design will be discussed with participants. Participants will evaluate the persuasiveness and user friendliness of eHealth interventions using the eHealthwiki.org (toolkit) and a persuasive model for system and content design. Finally, the workshop synthesizes views on innovative research methods to improve the uptake and impact of eHealth interventions. For the workshop we use our book, Improving eHealth(www.elevenpub.com)</p>', 'https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/how-to-improve-ehealth-interventions-in-health-psychology-and-beh', 0, 0, 0);

Despite involvement with patients with chronic conditions, dentists lack robust training on these conditions. The result is a less than ideal ability to identify medical issues during dental care and to modify treatment accordingly.</p>
<p>The use of eDental Records (EDRs) is increasing, and presents an opportunity to utilize technology to improve the quality and safety of care by dentists. This project conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of two clinical decision support (CDS) interventions designed to improve the quality and safety of dental care in patients with medically complex conditions, with particular focus on diabetes mellitus, xerostomia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>The main objectives of this project were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the effectiveness of integrated electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions toward changing dentist and patient behavior.</li>
<li>Determine the impact of an integrated EMR-based intervention upon the use of emergency and/or restorative dental care.</li>
<li>Produce and distribute a generalizable, replicable model of evidence-based care recommendations for implementing an integrated health information technology system for diabetes and other chronic illness management within dental care practices throughout the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two CDS interventions were implemented, one into the EDR targeted to providers, the other into the patient&rsquo;s personal health record (PHR) targeted to the patient. Fifteen dental practices, representing 102 dental care providers, were randomly assigned to one of the intervention arms or to the control group. The CDS was designed to promote the use of clinical care guidelines for complex medical conditions. Both interventions provided alerts about a patient&rsquo;s chronic condition and provided links to personalized, condition specific, evidence-based guidelines. For patients without a PHR, notification came via email or the mail. Providers were given information about the implication of the condition during the dental visit and patients were encouraged to discuss their condition with their provider.</p>
<p>Data collected over a 2 year period showed that providers and patients increased their access to the guidelines by 440 percent and 221 percent respectively during the first 6 months. The accuracy of providers documenting medical history and the preventive care recommended in the guidelines increased. No impact on complications was found, although complications were relatively low. However, it is important to note that dental providers&rsquo; use of the CDS system declined after the first 6 months despite the continued use of alerts. Despite the decline, the project findings supported the use of CDS for dental patients to enhance decisionmaking and to improve the quality and safety of care for patients with medical conditions.</p>', 'https://digital.ahrq.gov/ahrq-funded-projects/ehealth-records-improve-dental-care-patients-chronic-illnesses', 0, 0, 0);

The system is being tested by patients in a clinical trial at UC San Diego Health. It is intended to help health care teams prioritize more critical patients, while also providing data on which symptoms are most indicative of healing or further progression of COVID-19.</p>
<div class="article-banner first-banner">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Currently at UC San Diego Health, <a class="textTag" href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patients/" rel="tag">patients</a> who test positive for the virus but aren''t in need of hospitalization are sent home to recover, with care team members calling patients daily to monitor symptoms and determine whether additional interventions are necessary.</p>
<p>However, not all health systems have the resources and capacity to support such an effort.</p>
<p>With the eCOVID remote monitoring platform, that process is automated. Patients use a wearable Engineers at the University of California San Diego have developed a remote monitoring platform for patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 but aren''t in need of hospitalization. The system is being tested by patients in a clinical trial at UC San Diego Health.device to continuously monitor vital signs such as heart rate and oxygen saturation levels, as well as activity and sleep levels. They also complete a daily questionnaire about their symptoms, such as fatigue, cough and shortness of breath, using the eCOVID app.</p>
<p>This information is automatically transmitted to a secure dashboard that <a class="textTag" href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+care+providers/" rel="tag">health care providers</a> can monitor; the app and dashboard are interactive&mdash;providing guidance and alerts to both the care team and patients, as well as receiving feedback from the care team. This can reduce anxiety for patients who are healing as expected, and allows the health care team members to focus more attention on patients in greater need.</p>
<p>"We wanted to jump in and help in a real translational way," said Sujit Dey, professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC San Diego, director of the UC San Diego Center for Wireless Communications, and lead of this remote monitoring platform. "We looked to see what technology we had in our arsenal that we could repurpose to help the COVID-19 patients and the <a class="textTag" href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+care+workers/" rel="tag">health care workers</a> treating them."</p>
<p>The technology behind the eCOVID app derives from a similar virtual system Dey and colleagues developed to monitor and provide personalized care for hypertensive patients, using machine learning to better understand which health behaviors were most impactful to personalized blood pressure levels. The information was used to provide behavioral guidance.</p>
<div class="w-100 mb-4 d-print-none">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A team of engineers worked with physicians at UC San Diego Health to repurpose this system to one capable of alleviating some of the additional workload health care personnel face with the COVID-19 pandemic, while also contributing to positive patient outcomes and a global understanding of the virus.</p>
<p>"The eCOVID app provides us with concrete information daily regarding each patient''s clinical status, allowing us to prioritize who needs to be personally contacted that day," said Dr. Michelle Ritter, an infectious diseases specialist at UC San Diego Health and director of the COVID-19 telemedicine clinic, who collaborated with the engineering team on the eCovid app. "It also gives patients peace of mind knowing that they are being monitored and can quickly convey any changes in their status to our COVID team."</p>
<p>In a second phase of the project, Dey plans to use machine learning algorithms and data from the patients'' vital signs, health behavior and self-reported symptoms to try and understand if changes in certain <a class="textTag" href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vital+signs/" rel="tag">vital signs</a> and behaviors can indicate an expected change in symptoms and a patient''s condition. This could lead to more predictive and effective care. They''ll also try to determine if certain symptoms are more indicative of a severe case of infection than others. This could result in more personalized care, and even preemptive hospitalization before the situation becomes dire, which could improve patient outcomes and give hospital systems time to prepare and allocate resources.</p>
<p>The app can be scaled to other <a class="textTag" href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+systems/" rel="tag">health systems</a> as well, which may not have the resources to conduct daily check-in calls.</p>
<p>"If done properly and in collaboration with physicians, virtual monitoring platforms such as the eCOVID system can provide great benefits for health care systems," said Dey. "Not only for COVID-19, but for many ongoing and common health issues, being able to monitor a patient''s status continuously and engage with them by providing personalized guidance and care is an ideal solution."</p>', 'https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-ecovid-platform-remote-patient.html', 0, 0, 0);
